# Introduction
The University of Amsterdam (UvA) is committed and responsible for the careful handling of research data, from project registration to the archiving and dissemination of valuable outcomes. Given the advancements in Open Science, prioritizing transparency and the reuse of research data are very important. To achieve this the UvA should follow the FAIR principles: research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable. Of course, there may be valid reasons not to make data openly available; the principle here is as open as possible, but as closed as necessary.

While progress is made in implementing RDM policies, support, and infrastructures, research data are still archived and published insufficiently. This concern emphasizes the need for the UvA to improve data deposition practices. To address this, the ‘Research Data Hub’ (RDH) project seeks to streamline and automate archiving and publication processes as much as possible. With the aim to ensure efficient data management which relieves the burden on researchers and support staff. 

In short, you can think of the RDH as a spider in the web (a middleware with an interface), that: 
- Enables (automatic) transport of data from one location (e.g., a workspace such as Research Drive, OneDrive, local storage, VRE, PC, etc.) to another location (e.g., archive system such as SURF Tape);  
- Ingests and manages metadata from different sources (e.g., RMS and lab or research journals) in a central repository; 
- Facilitates the publication of metadata (sometimes with datasets) in internal databases/ catalogues such as Figshare, Pure/UvA Dare, or external repositories such as OSF, DANS, Zenodo, etc.
